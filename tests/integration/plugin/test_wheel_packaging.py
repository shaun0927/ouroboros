"""Integration test: built wheel ships the vendored 0.1 schema assets.

This guards the failure mode the round-2 bot review flagged and
round-4 sharpened: the unit-level `resources.files()` check passes
against the editable source tree even when `pyproject.toml` is
mis-configured, so it cannot catch a `force-include` regression on
its own. This test rebuilds the wheel for real and inspects the
shipped archive.
