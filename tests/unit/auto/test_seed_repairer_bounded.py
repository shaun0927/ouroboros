"""Bounded-iteration regression tests for SeedRepairer.converge.

Issue #775 introduces an explicit ``max_iterations`` cap on the convergence
loop and an outer ``asyncio.wait_for`` budget around the synchronous
``repairer.converge`` call inside ``AutoPipeline.run``. These tests pin both
guarantees so a future regression cannot reintroduce an unbounded LLM-spend
hang.
