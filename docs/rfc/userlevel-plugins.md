# RFC: UserLevel Plugin Layer

## Status

**Accepted (2026-05-07)**, supersedes the growth-oriented portions of #725.

This RFC pins the framing decisions converged on in #725 and the seven
contract decisions locked in [Q00/ouroboros-plugins](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins)
issues #5–#11. Future debates about "should this go in core?" or "should we
add this to `ooo auto`?" should be answered against this document.

### Implementation Status

"Accepted" means the **design** is locked; it does **not** mean every
artifact named below already exists in the repository. This RFC is the
**target contract** — implementer-facing prose throughout this document
uses present tense for that contract, and readers SHOULD interpret
unbuilt artifacts as RFC-2119 **MUST** (the implementation must conform
when it lands), not as a description of `main` today.

The matrix below tracks where each artifact stands at the moment this RFC
is merged. Concrete paths and commands referenced later in the document
(`src/ouroboros/plugin/firewall.py:invoke_plugin`, `scripts/sync-plugin-schemas.sh`,
`ooo plugin add`, etc.) are **target paths**, not current paths, unless
this matrix marks them as shipped.

| Artifact | Tracking issue | Status at RFC merge |
|---|---|---|
| Plugin manifest schemas under upstream `schemas/0.1/` (incl. `audit-event.schema.json`) | upstream Q00/ouroboros-plugins #6, #11 | **Shipped upstream** |
| Vendored copy at `src/ouroboros/plugin/schemas/0.1/` + `_source.json` | #736 | Not yet present in core |
| `scripts/sync-plugin-schemas.sh` | #736 | Not yet present |
| `src/ouroboros/plugin/manifest.py` (loader) | #728 | Not yet present |
| `src/ouroboros/plugin/firewall.py:invoke_plugin` (invocation contract) | #729 | Not yet present |
| `ooo plugin {add,install,trust,disable,remove}` (state-mutating CLI) | #731 | Not yet present |
| `ooo plugin {discover,inspect,list}` (read-only CLI) | #731 | Not yet present |
| `~/.ouroboros/plugins.lock` + trust store | #732 | Not yet present |
| `ooo auto` domain-keyword CI lint guard | #735 | Not yet present |
| `github-pr-ops` E2E contract proof | #733 | Not yet present |

Two consequences flow from this matrix that other sections of this
document refer back to:

1. **Boundary enforcement is currently documentary, not mechanical.** The
   "ooo auto Boundary" section describes #735 as the durable, evergreen
   control. That control activates only when #735 lands. Until then, the
   boundary is held by review discipline plus the historical evidence
   captured in that section. The clause "this RFC must be revisited if
   the guard is ever removed or weakened" therefore takes effect from the
   moment #735 ships, not from the moment this RFC merges.
2. **Implementation PRs that build the unbuilt rows above MUST conform to
   this RFC.** Drift between this contract and what those PRs ship is a
   bug in the PR, not a license to amend the RFC silently — amendments
   require a follow-up RFC change against this document.

## Motivation

Ouroboros core risks expanding indefinitely as new operational workflows are
proposed. #689's GitHub-PR work was the inflection point: it crossed two
boundaries simultaneously — it was neither an OS primitive nor part of the
`ooo auto` product boundary, yet there was no third home. The defense-oriented
plugin layer described here is that third home.

The plugin layer exists to **keep core small**, not to grow ecosystem surface
area. Specifically:

- We do not pursue plugin count, marketplace dynamics, or "ecosystem health"
  as success metrics. The success metric for Ouroboros remains the strength
  of the spec-first discipline (Interview / Seed / Evolve / Provenance) and
  the quality of execution under that discipline.
- Reference plugins are deliberately few, high-quality, and maintained by
  core authors or co-maintainers — not a long-tail catalog.
- Lock-in for Ouroboros comes from the spec-first discipline and the
  durable substrate (ledger, provenance, seed history), not from how many
  plugins exist on top.
- The plugin layer is plumbing. It exists invisibly to prevent core bloat.
  It is not a product surface.

The same diagram lives in
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins/docs/architecture.md](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/blob/main/docs/architecture.md)
and is the canonical reference for both repos.

## Why Defense-Oriented

Three reasons the plugin layer is plumbing, not a product:

1. **Lock-in for Ouroboros comes from the spec-first discipline, not from
   plugin count.** Interview → Seed → Evolve → Provenance is the unique
   value. GitHub PR ops, Jira sync, Slack incident response — every adjacent
   tool has those. Plugins are commodity; spec-first discipline is not.
2. **Ecosystem-driven lock-in is fragile at this scale.** A healthy
   ecosystem (governance, security review, breaking-change discipline,
   support) is operationally expensive. Maintainer cost grows with the
   ecosystem and the unique value gets diluted.
3. **A user-facing "AI workflow App Store" is not what `ooo` should sell.**
   The promise of `ooo auto "do X"` is "spec-first agent does the right
   thing." Adding "...but first, browse the marketplace and install the
   right plugin" makes the entry experience worse, not better.

The success metric is therefore **"the boundary holds"** — measurable, not
"plugin count" — vague.

## Manifest Schema

Authoritative source:
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins/schemas/0.1/plugin.schema.json](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/blob/main/schemas/0.1/plugin.schema.json).

Per the locked decision in
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins#6](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/issues/6),
the manifest carries **8 required + 2 optional** top-level fields:

- **Required (8)**: `schema_version`, `name`, `version`, `source`,
  `commands`, `capabilities`, `permissions`, `entrypoint`.
- **Optional (2)**: `description` (default `""`), `audit` (default
  `{events: [plugin.invoked, plugin.permission_used, plugin.completed,
  plugin.failed]}`).

Each required field is load-bearing for some part of the lifecycle, lockfile,
or firewall; each optional field has a sensible default the firewall provides
unconditionally.

The `source.type` enum is `local_path | plugin_home | first_party`. Per
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins#8](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/issues/8),
first-party programs share the manifest format and are registered at core
boot, bypassing the user-facing `discovered → installed → trusted` flow.

**First-party trust semantics.** Because first-party programs are shipped
inside the same release artifact as core (i.e. their manifests are not
attacker-controlled), all permissions they declare — including
`required: true` — are treated as **implicitly trusted at boot** by the
firewall (see Invocation Contract below). The boot-time registration step
populates the trust store with these grants in-process; there is no
user-visible "trust" prompt for first-party programs and no path for users
to revoke them short of disabling the program. This is the deliberate
contract: first-party programs MAY declare `required: true` permissions,
and conforming firewalls MUST NOT block them on the trust check. Plugins
that are not first-party never receive this treatment regardless of
`source.type`.

The manifest schema versions per
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins#11](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/issues/11):
SemVer-style `MAJOR.MINOR`. Each released `MAJOR.MINOR` lives in its own
directory under upstream `schemas/<MAJOR.MINOR>/` (e.g. `schemas/0.1/`,
`schemas/0.2/`, `schemas/1.0/`). The support window is *current MAJOR +
previous MAJOR*; older MAJORs may be retained for archival reading but are
out-of-window for compatibility guarantees.

### Vendoring strategy in core (resolves #736)

Ouroboros core vendors the schemas at
`src/ouroboros/plugin/schemas/<MAJOR.MINOR>/`, **mirroring the upstream
directory layout one-for-one** (so the URL `schemas/0.1/plugin.schema.json`
maps to vendored `src/ouroboros/plugin/schemas/0.1/plugin.schema.json`).
Each vendored directory contains a `_source.json` recording the upstream
git SHA at the time of the copy. The `scripts/sync-plugin-schemas.sh`
script copies all in-window MAJOR.MINOR directories from a pinned upstream
SHA. CI may surface drift as a warning until the schemas stabilize at v1;
this is intentionally less strict than a hard error to keep bring-up
smooth.

## Invocation Contract

Every UserLevel plugin command flows through one wrapper —
`src/ouroboros/plugin/firewall.py:invoke_plugin` (#729).

The wrapper's responsibilities, in order:

1. **Pre-invocation trust check.** If any `required: true` permission is not
   trusted, emit only `plugin.failed` with `result.status="blocked"` and a
   message naming the missing scope and the exact `ooo plugin trust ...`
   command to run (the canonical CLI entrypoint for the lifecycle commands;
   `ouroboros` is not a separate user-facing command). **No `plugin.invoked`
   is emitted** — the plugin never started.
2. **Confirmation gate.** If the resolved command has
   `requires_confirmation: true`, show a single confirmation prompt. Per
   [Q00/ouroboros-plugins#9 Q2](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/issues/9),
   this is the only confirmation; permission risk is handled at trust grant
   time.
3. **Emit `plugin.invoked`** before launching the entrypoint subprocess.
4. **Emit `plugin.permission_used`** for each `required: true` permission
   declared in the manifest. Optional permissions (`required: false`) are
   not emitted by default in v0; this is the deliberately coarse Option (a)
   from #729's spec. The path to graduate to per-call granular emission
   (stderr-line or sidecar file) is open but not implemented.
5. **Run entrypoint** out-of-process (subprocess via the manifest's declared
   command).
6. **Emit `plugin.completed` or `plugin.failed`** with `result.status` and
   the subprocess exit code.

Audit events conform to
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins/schemas/0.1/audit-event.schema.json](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/blob/main/schemas/0.1/audit-event.schema.json).
The compatibility surface between this schema and the existing core ledger
writer is tracked in #737.

### Audit-event compatibility (resolves #737)

The audit-event schema is the canonical shape for plugin-emitted events. The
core ledger writer accepts these events as-is, with any core-level envelope
(e.g. ledger-internal sequence numbers) added at a layer **above** the
schema's `additionalProperties: false` boundary. No silent field truncation
or expansion is permitted; mismatches produce errors, not warnings.

**Bounded payloads — argv handling.** The "tokens, channel IDs, and
free-form user messages are forbidden" rule applies to **plugin-defined
audit fields** (fields the plugin populates inside `plugin.invoked` /
`plugin.permission_used` / `plugin.completed` / `plugin.failed` event
payloads). For `argv` specifically the contract is **defense in depth**;
treating argv as either fully trusted or fully redacted is unsafe.

1. **Plugins MUST NOT accept secrets via argv.** Plugin authors MUST
   document a secure path (env var, file, OS keychain) for any
   credential a command needs and MUST reject argv-supplied secrets at
   parse time when feasible. This is the primary control.
2. **The firewall MUST apply a built-in argv redaction policy before
   ledger write**, as a safety net for the case where rule (1) is
   violated by accident. The minimum policy redacts:
   - Values of well-known secret flags by name match
     (e.g. `--token=…`, `--password=…`, `--api-key=…`, `--secret=…`,
     and the value position immediately following those flags),
   - Tokens with high-confidence formats (`Bearer …`, `gh[oprsu]_…`,
     `sk-…`, AWS-style `AKIA…`, JWT-shaped strings with three
     dot-separated base64url segments).
   Redacted positions are replaced with the literal string `[redacted]`
   in the ledger record. The hash of the original argv (sha256 over the
   un-redacted form) MAY be recorded alongside for forensic
   reconciliation, but the original value MUST NOT.
3. **Plugins MAY tighten the policy per command.** A plugin MAY declare
   additional flags or positional indexes to redact via a future
   manifest extension; the v0 manifest does not yet expose this, so v0
   redaction is exactly the built-in policy in (2). Adding the
   per-command redaction list is tracked alongside the granular
   permission emission work in the Deferred Decisions section.
4. **Caller responsibility persists.** The firewall's safety net does
   not absolve callers (`ooo` CLI, first-party programs, scripts/CI) of
   the obligation to keep secrets out of argv in the first place; the
   safety net exists to limit blast radius, not to make argv a
   sanctioned secret channel.

Provenance fields in audit events are string-only per the
[`audit-event.schema.json`](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/blob/main/schemas/0.1/audit-event.schema.json)
constraint set (the schema is the canonical source; this RFC does not
introduce a separate `docs/audit.md` contract). Raw stdout/stderr is
**not** copied into the ledger; only a sha256 hash is recorded for
forensic comparison.

## UX

The user-facing install path is `ooo plugin add <repo-url>`. The repository
URL is the unit of distribution; the catalog inside the repository is the
unit of selection. Full UX details:
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins/docs/lifecycle.md](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/blob/main/docs/lifecycle.md).

**`add` vs `install`.** `add` is the **interactive entry point** intended
for humans: it accepts a repo URL, fetches the catalog, presents the
selection prompt, and then internally invokes `install` for each selected
plugin. `install` is the **non-interactive primitive** addressed by
plugin name (e.g. `ooo plugin install github-pr-ops`), used when the
repository is already known to the system or when scripts/CI need to
bypass the prompt. The two commands are layered, not redundant: `add`
calls `install`; `install` never calls `add`.

**Plugin name → command-namespace mapping.** Every installed plugin's
manifest `name` field IS the user-facing command namespace, with no
aliasing: a plugin named `github-pr-ops` is invoked as
`ooo github-pr-ops <command> [args...]`, where `<command>` is one of
the entries declared in the manifest's `commands` array (each `commands`
entry's own `name` is the subcommand). Manifest `name` therefore doubles
as a uniqueness key in the trust store and as the CLI namespace.
Aliases, short names, and namespace collisions across repos are
explicitly out of scope for v0 — if two installed plugins declare the
same `name`, `ooo plugin install` MUST refuse the second one with a
collision error.

```bash
$ ooo plugin add https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins
Repository: Q00/ouroboros-plugins (b3a91f2)

Select plugins to install:

  [x] github-pr-ops      0.1.0   review and prepare PR merges

Press space to toggle, enter to confirm, esc to cancel.

$ ooo plugin trust github-pr-ops --scope github:read
$ ooo github-pr-ops review https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros/pull/725
```

Anti-pattern install strings (e.g.
`git+https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins.git#plugins/github-pr-ops`)
are explicitly rejected because they leak repository layout into the
user-visible URL. Plugin authors must be free to refactor their repos
without breaking installs.

## Reference Plugin

[Q00/ouroboros-plugins](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins) is the
**curated** reference repo, not a marketplace. It hosts the contract
artifacts (schemas, validator) and one v0 reference plugin —
`github-pr-ops` — whose purpose is to **prove the contract**, not populate
an ecosystem. Other plugins live in their authors' own repositories and
install via `ooo plugin add <author-repo-url>`.

`github-pr-ops` ships with one command: `review` (read-only). The
destructive `merge` command is intentionally absent from v0 per
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins#7](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/issues/7);
it returns when the destructive trust UX (#9) is in place.

## ooo auto Boundary

`ooo auto` is a **first-party UserLevel program**, not core. Its product
boundary is permanent:

```text
goal → clarification/interview → Seed → validation → execution handoff
```

Domain-specific operational workflows do not live here. They live in
plugins.

**Historical rationale (not an evergreen claim).** When this RFC was
drafted, `grep -nE 'github|pull_request' src/ouroboros/cli/commands/auto.py src/ouroboros/auto/pipeline.py`
returned empty, and the closed status of the #689 PR stack
(`#697`, `#707`, `#712`, `#715`, `#721`) showed the project had already
been rejecting domain-specific intrusions into `ooo auto` on a per-PR
basis. This RFC promotes that de facto rejection to a de jure boundary.

The **future enforcement** of the boundary is mechanical, not
documentary: #735 will add a CI lint guard that fails any PR
re-introducing domain-specific keywords into the `ooo auto` code path.
Once that guard ships (status tracked in the Implementation Status
matrix), it — not the historical snapshot above — becomes the evergreen
control, and the "must be revisited if weakened" clause takes effect from
that point. Until #735 lands, the boundary is held by review discipline
plus the evidence captured here.

## Deferred Decisions

These are intentionally postponed until a real plugin demonstrates the
need. Adding any of them speculatively violates the
"contract emerges from what the plugin actually exercises" principle.

- **Granular `plugin.permission_used` emission.** v0 emits one event per
  declared `required: true` permission at invocation start. Per-call
  emission via stderr-line or sidecar (Options (b)/(c) in #729) is open
  but unimplemented.
- **Per-repo trust grants.** v0 stores trust per-user. A future opt-in
  per-repo policy file is possible but not designed.
- **MCP-tool publication via plugins.** Partly resolved by the firewall
  (#729); remaining MCP-specific concerns to file separately if surfaced.
- **Plugin-update flow (`ooo plugin update`).** v0 ships the eight plugin
  commands locked in #731, split as follows:
  - **State-mutating** (write the trust store / lockfile / installed set):
    `add`, `install`, `trust`, `disable`, `remove`.
  - **Read-only** (no persistent state change): `discover`, `inspect`,
    `list`.
  The single deferred verb is the `update` *transition* — a separate
  in-place upgrade command. It lands when a real upgrade need surfaces;
  until then, `remove` + `add` is the documented upgrade path.
- **Automated migration scripts** for MAJOR-version manifest schema bumps.
  v0 → v1 (whenever it happens) ships with a manual migration guide.
- **Hosted catalog / index server.** Permanent non-goal: marketplace as a
  product surface is a non-goal of #725.
