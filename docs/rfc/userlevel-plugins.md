# RFC: UserLevel Plugin Layer

## Status

**Accepted (2026-05-07)**, supersedes the growth-oriented portions of #725.

This RFC pins the framing decisions converged on in #725 and the seven
contract decisions locked in [Q00/ouroboros-plugins](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins)
issues #5–#11. Future debates about "should this go in core?" or "should we
add this to `ooo auto`?" should be answered against this document.

## Motivation

Ouroboros core risks expanding indefinitely as new operational workflows are
proposed. #689's GitHub-PR work was the inflection point: it crossed two
boundaries simultaneously — it was neither an OS primitive nor part of the
`ooo auto` product boundary, yet there was no third home. The defense-oriented
plugin layer described here is that third home.

The plugin layer exists to **keep core small**, not to grow ecosystem surface
area. Specifically:

- We do not pursue plugin count, marketplace dynamics, or "ecosystem health"
  as success metrics. The success metric for Ouroboros remains the strength
  of the spec-first discipline (Interview / Seed / Evolve / Provenance) and
  the quality of execution under that discipline.
- Reference plugins are deliberately few, high-quality, and maintained by
  core authors or co-maintainers — not a long-tail catalog.
- Lock-in for Ouroboros comes from the spec-first discipline and the
  durable substrate (ledger, provenance, seed history), not from how many
  plugins exist on top.
- The plugin layer is plumbing. It exists invisibly to prevent core bloat.
  It is not a product surface.

The same diagram lives in
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins/docs/architecture.md](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/blob/main/docs/architecture.md)
and is the canonical reference for both repos.

## Why Defense-Oriented

Three reasons the plugin layer is plumbing, not a product:

1. **Lock-in for Ouroboros comes from the spec-first discipline, not from
   plugin count.** Interview → Seed → Evolve → Provenance is the unique
   value. GitHub PR ops, Jira sync, Slack incident response — every adjacent
   tool has those. Plugins are commodity; spec-first discipline is not.
2. **Ecosystem-driven lock-in is fragile at this scale.** A healthy
   ecosystem (governance, security review, breaking-change discipline,
   support) is operationally expensive. Maintainer cost grows with the
   ecosystem and the unique value gets diluted.
3. **A user-facing "AI workflow App Store" is not what `ooo` should sell.**
   The promise of `ooo auto "do X"` is "spec-first agent does the right
   thing." Adding "...but first, browse the marketplace and install the
   right plugin" makes the entry experience worse, not better.

The success metric is therefore **"the boundary holds"** — measurable, not
"plugin count" — vague.

## Manifest Schema

Authoritative source:
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins/schemas/0.1/plugin.schema.json](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/blob/main/schemas/0.1/plugin.schema.json).

Per the locked decision in
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins#6](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/issues/6),
the manifest carries **8 required + 2 optional** top-level fields:

- **Required (8)**: `schema_version`, `name`, `version`, `source`,
  `commands`, `capabilities`, `permissions`, `entrypoint`.
- **Optional (2)**: `description` (default `""`), `audit` (default
  `{events: [plugin.invoked, plugin.permission_used, plugin.completed,
  plugin.failed]}`).

Each required field is load-bearing for some part of the lifecycle, lockfile,
or firewall; each optional field has a sensible default the firewall provides
unconditionally.

The `source.type` enum is `local_path | plugin_home | first_party`. Per
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins#8](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/issues/8),
first-party programs share the manifest format and are registered at core
boot, bypassing the user-facing `discovered → installed → trusted` flow.

**First-party trust semantics.** Because first-party programs are shipped
inside the same release artifact as core (i.e. their manifests are not
attacker-controlled), all permissions they declare — including
`required: true` — are treated as **implicitly trusted at boot** by the
firewall (see Invocation Contract below). The boot-time registration step
populates the trust store with these grants in-process; there is no
user-visible "trust" prompt for first-party programs and no path for users
to revoke them short of disabling the program. This is the deliberate
contract: first-party programs MAY declare `required: true` permissions,
and conforming firewalls MUST NOT block them on the trust check. Plugins
that are not first-party never receive this treatment regardless of
`source.type`.

The manifest schema versions per
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins#11](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/issues/11):
SemVer-style `MAJOR.MINOR`, current MAJOR + previous MAJOR support window,
archived per-major directories (`schemas/<major>/`).

### Vendoring strategy in core (resolves #736)

Ouroboros core vendors the schemas at
`src/ouroboros/plugin/schemas/<major>/` with a `_source.json` recording the
upstream git SHA. A `scripts/sync-plugin-schemas.sh` script keeps the
vendored copies in sync. CI may surface drift as a warning until the schemas
stabilize at v1; this is intentionally less strict than a hard error to keep
bring-up smooth.

## Invocation Contract

Every UserLevel plugin command flows through one wrapper —
`src/ouroboros/plugin/firewall.py:invoke_plugin` (#729).

The wrapper's responsibilities, in order:

1. **Pre-invocation trust check.** If any `required: true` permission is not
   trusted, emit only `plugin.failed` with `result.status="blocked"` and a
   message naming the missing scope and the exact `ooo plugin trust ...`
   command to run (the canonical CLI entrypoint for the lifecycle commands;
   `ouroboros` is not a separate user-facing command). **No `plugin.invoked`
   is emitted** — the plugin never started.
2. **Confirmation gate.** If the resolved command has
   `requires_confirmation: true`, show a single confirmation prompt. Per
   [Q00/ouroboros-plugins#9 Q2](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/issues/9),
   this is the only confirmation; permission risk is handled at trust grant
   time.
3. **Emit `plugin.invoked`** before launching the entrypoint subprocess.
4. **Emit `plugin.permission_used`** for each `required: true` permission
   declared in the manifest. Optional permissions (`required: false`) are
   not emitted by default in v0; this is the deliberately coarse Option (a)
   from #729's spec. The path to graduate to per-call granular emission
   (stderr-line or sidecar file) is open but not implemented.
5. **Run entrypoint** out-of-process (subprocess via the manifest's declared
   command).
6. **Emit `plugin.completed` or `plugin.failed`** with `result.status` and
   the subprocess exit code.

Audit events conform to
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins/schemas/0.1/audit-event.schema.json](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/blob/main/schemas/0.1/audit-event.schema.json).
The compatibility surface between this schema and the existing core ledger
writer is tracked in #737.

### Audit-event compatibility (resolves #737)

The audit-event schema is the canonical shape for plugin-emitted events. The
core ledger writer accepts these events as-is, with any core-level envelope
(e.g. ledger-internal sequence numbers) added at a layer **above** the
schema's `additionalProperties: false` boundary. No silent field truncation
or expansion is permitted; mismatches produce errors, not warnings.

Bounded payloads: argv is recorded as-is, **including** any argv tokens —
the firewall does not redact, validate, or rewrite argv contents. The
"tokens, channel IDs, and free-form user messages are forbidden" rule
therefore applies to **plugin-defined audit fields** (i.e. fields the
plugin populates inside `plugin.invoked` / `plugin.permission_used` /
`plugin.completed` / `plugin.failed` event payloads), not to argv. The
contractual obligation to keep secrets out of argv is on the **caller**
(`ooo` CLI invocations and first-party programs that shell out to a
plugin); plugins MUST refuse to accept secrets via argv and MUST document
the secure path (env, file, OS keychain) instead. Provenance is
string-only per `docs/audit.md`. Raw stdout/stderr is **not** copied into
the ledger; only a sha256 hash is recorded for forensic comparison.

## UX

The user-facing install path is `ooo plugin add <repo-url>`. The repository
URL is the unit of distribution; the catalog inside the repository is the
unit of selection. Full UX details:
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins/docs/lifecycle.md](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/blob/main/docs/lifecycle.md).

```bash
$ ooo plugin add https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins
Repository: Q00/ouroboros-plugins (b3a91f2)

Select plugins to install:

  [x] github-pr-ops      0.1.0   review and prepare PR merges

Press space to toggle, enter to confirm, esc to cancel.

$ ooo plugin trust github-pr-ops --scope github:read
$ ooo github-pr review https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros/pull/725
```

Anti-pattern install strings (e.g.
`git+https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins.git#plugins/github-pr-ops`)
are explicitly rejected because they leak repository layout into the
user-visible URL. Plugin authors must be free to refactor their repos
without breaking installs.

## Reference Plugin

[Q00/ouroboros-plugins](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins) is the
**curated** reference repo, not a marketplace. It hosts the contract
artifacts (schemas, validator) and one v0 reference plugin —
`github-pr-ops` — whose purpose is to **prove the contract**, not populate
an ecosystem. Other plugins live in their authors' own repositories and
install via `ooo plugin add <author-repo-url>`.

`github-pr-ops` ships with one command: `review` (read-only). The
destructive `merge` command is intentionally absent from v0 per
[Q00/ouroboros-plugins#7](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros-plugins/issues/7);
it returns when the destructive trust UX (#9) is in place.

## ooo auto Boundary

`ooo auto` is a **first-party UserLevel program**, not core. Its product
boundary is permanent:

```text
goal → clarification/interview → Seed → validation → execution handoff
```

Domain-specific operational workflows do not live here. They live in
plugins. As of this RFC's merge, `grep -nE 'github|pull_request' src/ouroboros/cli/commands/auto.py src/ouroboros/auto/pipeline.py` returns empty — the
boundary is intact today. The closed status of the #689 PR stack
(`#697`, `#707`, `#712`, `#715`, `#721`) confirms the project's de facto
position; this RFC makes it the de jure position.

#735 adds a CI lint guard preventing future PRs from re-introducing
domain-specific keywords into `ooo auto`'s code path.

## Deferred Decisions

These are intentionally postponed until a real plugin demonstrates the
need. Adding any of them speculatively violates the
"contract emerges from what the plugin actually exercises" principle.

- **Granular `plugin.permission_used` emission.** v0 emits one event per
  declared `required: true` permission at invocation start. Per-call
  emission via stderr-line or sidecar (Options (b)/(c) in #729) is open
  but unimplemented.
- **Per-repo trust grants.** v0 stores trust per-user. A future opt-in
  per-repo policy file is possible but not designed.
- **MCP-tool publication via plugins.** Partly resolved by the firewall
  (#729); remaining MCP-specific concerns to file separately if surfaced.
- **Plugin-update flow (`ooo plugin update`).** "Lifecycle" here refers
  narrowly to **state-transition commands** (the verbs that move a plugin
  between `discovered → installed → trusted → disabled → removed`); the
  read-only verbs `add`, `discover`, and `list` from the v0 CLI in #731
  remain shipped, they simply do not transition state. The deferred verb
  is the `update` transition specifically; v0 ships
  install/inspect/trust/disable/remove and adds `update` when a real
  in-place upgrade need surfaces.
- **Automated migration scripts** for MAJOR-version manifest schema bumps.
  v0 → v1 (whenever it happens) ships with a manual migration guide.
- **Hosted catalog / index server.** Permanent non-goal: marketplace as a
  product surface is a non-goal of #725.
