> Related: [#836](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros/issues/836) (watchdog directive mapping), [#476](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros/issues/476) Phase 2 Agent OS roadmap, [#492](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros/pull/492) (`control.directive.emitted` factory).

## Summary

Three independent timeout surfaces exist today. Each raises or returns its own
timeout representation and signals cancellation through its own mechanism.
They do not provide a consistent, source-specific `control.directive.emitted`
signal, so the control plane has no unified visibility into why a run was
interrupted. This RFC proposes a contract that maps every timeout surface onto
the `Directive` vocabulary and requires each site to emit
`control.directive.emitted` as the canonical control-plane signal.

## Context

### Surface 1 — MCP tool timeout

**Files:** `src/ouroboros/mcp/errors.py`, `src/ouroboros/mcp/client/manager.py`,
`src/ouroboros/orchestrator/mcp_tools.py`, `src/ouroboros/config/models.py`

`MCPTimeoutError` (defined in `src/ouroboros/mcp/errors.py:170`) is a subclass
of `MCPClientError` and is returned as `Result.err(...)` by the MCP client
manager (`src/ouroboros/mcp/client/manager.py:460–463`) when an MCP tool call
exceeds its wall-clock budget. The timeout budget is controlled by
`RuntimeControlsConfig.mcp_tool_timeout_seconds` (default `0`, which disables
the adapter-level guard):

```python
# src/ouroboros/config/models.py:322
mcp_tool_timeout_seconds: float = Field(default=0, ge=0)
```

`MCPTimeoutError` is marked `is_retriable=True` at construction. The retry
logic in `src/ouroboros/orchestrator/mcp_tools.py:2156` catches raised
`(MCPConnectionError, asyncio.TimeoutError)` exceptions and re-attempts up to
`MAX_RETRIES` times before emitting the structured log event
`orchestrator.mcp_tools.timeout_after_retries` and returning a non-retriable
tool error. Manager-originated `MCPTimeoutError` values currently bypass that
exception retry path because they are returned as `Result.err(...)`; the
orchestrator converts them through its generic `call_failed` path. No
`control.directive.emitted` event is produced.

### Surface 2 — Generation watchdog timeout

**Files:** `src/ouroboros/evolution/watchdog.py`, `src/ouroboros/config/models.py`

`GenerationWatchdogTimeout` (defined in `src/ouroboros/evolution/watchdog.py:65`)
is raised by `GenerationProgressWatchdog._raise_if_threshold_exceeded` when one
of three thresholds is breached:

- `generation_idle_timeout_seconds` (default 7200 s) — no event activity
- `generation_no_progress_timeout_seconds` (default 14400 s) — activity without
  material progress
- `generation_safety_timeout_seconds` (default `0`, disabled) — absolute
  wall-clock cap

When raised, the watchdog calls `emit_decision(action="timeout", ...)` which
persists a `lineage.generation.watchdog_decision` event via the `EventStore`.
This is a lineage-scoped event, not a `control.directive.emitted` event, so it
does not appear in the control-plane directive stream. One caller path,
`evolve_step`, can later convert the failed step into a generic
`control.directive.emitted` event with `emitted_by="evolver"`; that does not
identify the watchdog timeout as the source surface.

### Surface 3 — Auto-run handoff timeout

**Files:** `src/ouroboros/auto/pipeline.py`, `src/ouroboros/config/models.py`

The auto pipeline coordinates interview, seed generation, repair, review, run
handoff, Ralph handoff/poll, evaluator, and lateral-thinker phases. Each
long-running phase runs under a `TimeoutError`-bounded `asyncio` call. The
run-start phase is the most nuanced: a first `TimeoutError` sets
`run_handoff_status = "unknown_timeout"` and schedules one retry; a second
`TimeoutError` on the retry leaves the status as `"unknown_timeout"` and blocks
further attempts. The `"unknown_retry_failed"` status is used by the non-timeout
exception path on the retry:

```python
# src/ouroboros/auto/pipeline.py:801–814
except TimeoutError as exc:
    if self._enforce_deadline(state):
        return self._result(state, ledger, review=review, blocker=state.last_error)
    _mark_unknown_run_handoff(state, status="unknown_timeout")
    if retried:
        state.run_handoff_guidance = (...)
        state.mark_blocked(...)
        ...
        return self._result(...)
```

No `control.directive.emitted` event is produced for any phase timeout. The
caller learns about the timeout only through the in-memory/persisted `state`
object's `last_error`, phase, resume tool, and run/Ralph handoff fields.

## Problem

The three surfaces described above share no control-plane representation:

1. **Three exception types** — `MCPTimeoutError`, `GenerationWatchdogTimeout`,
   and `asyncio.TimeoutError` (handled in place by the auto pipeline and
   returned as blocked or early-return state) — carry incompatible fields and
   are caught at different abstraction levels.

2. **Three cancellation mechanisms** — the MCP layer retries internally then
   returns a terminal tool error; the watchdog cancels the async task then
   persists a lineage event; the auto pipeline writes to a mutable `state`
   object and returns early.

3. **No shared source-specific signal** — these timeout surfaces do not emit a
   consistent `control.directive.emitted` event at the timeout decision point. A
   lineage projector, TUI renderer, or external monitor cannot reconstruct
   *why* a run stopped from the directive journal alone.

This gap is item 5 of Q00/ouroboros#578, which asks for a unified
control-plane representation across all timeout surfaces so that consumers can
treat `control.directive.emitted` as the sole authoritative signal for "a
runtime decision was made here."

## Proposed contract

All three surfaces must emit `control.directive.emitted` via
`create_control_directive_emitted_event` from `src/ouroboros/events/control.py`
at the local timeout decision point. The event is the sole authoritative
control-plane signal that a timeout caused a retry, block, cancellation, or
early return. Existing exception types, state mutation, and lineage events
remain as local implementation details; consumers should derive timeout control
decisions from the directive journal, with non-terminal retry actionability
resolved against the owning surface's persisted retry-pending state as defined
in I4.

The `emitted_by` field distinguishes the source surface. The `directive` field
is determined per-surface as follows.

### Mapping table

| Surface | `emitted_by` | `directive` | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCP tool timeout | `"mcp.tool_timeout"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `MAX_RETRIES`/adapter retry envelope exhausted and terminal tool error returned |
| Watchdog timeout | `"generation.watchdog"` | same directive the evolution loop would emit for the failed generation outcome via `step_action_to_directive(...)` | generation retry/resilience-budget dependent |
| Auto interview timeout | `"auto.interview"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `interview_driver.run(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto seed-generation timeout | `"auto.seed_generation"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `seed_generator(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto repair timeout | `"auto.repair"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `repairer.converge(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto review timeout | `"auto.review"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `reviewer.review(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto handoff timeout — first occurrence | `"auto.run_handoff"` | `Directive.RETRY` | `run_handoff_status == "unknown_timeout"` and not yet retried |
| Auto handoff timeout — terminal | `"auto.run_handoff"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | retry exhausted while still `unknown_timeout`, retry failed with `unknown_retry_failed`, or deadline enforced |
| Auto Ralph handoff timeout | `"auto.ralph_handoff"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `ralph_starter(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto Ralph poll timeout | `"auto.ralph_poll"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `ralph_resumer(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto evaluator timeout | `"auto.evaluate"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `evaluator(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto lateral-thinker timeout | `"auto.lateral"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `lateral_thinker(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |

### MCP tool timeout mapping

`MCPTimeoutError` sets `is_retriable=True`, but Phase 1 must not translate that
flag into `Directive.RETRY`. The MCP adapter's retry envelope in
`src/ouroboros/orchestrator/mcp_tools.py` is currently in-memory:
`_call_with_retry(...)` uses `retry_async(..., attempts=MAX_RETRIES)` for raised
timeout paths, and manager-originated `Result.err(MCPTimeoutError)` values flow
through the generic `call_failed` conversion. Neither path persists a
retry-pending token or state that a resume consumer could later consult.

For current Phase 1, MCP internal retries are therefore invisible to the
directive journal. The MCP surface emits exactly one timeout directive, and
only at the terminal caller-visible decision point: `Directive.CANCEL` when the
`MAX_RETRIES`/adapter envelope is exhausted and the adapter returns the
terminal tool error, such as the existing
`orchestrator.mcp_tools.timeout_after_retries` path. Manager-originated
`Result.err(MCPTimeoutError)` values may be normalized into the same terminal
adapter envelope, but they still must not emit `Directive.RETRY` without a
durable retry token. A future MCP retry directive is allowed only if the MCP
surface first adds persisted retry-pending state that satisfies I4/I5. The
event target is either an execution/session/control target explicitly passed
through the `MCPToolProvider.call_tool(...)` and `_call_with_retry(...)` call
chain, or a different currently available aggregation target selected by the
implementation and documented with its resume semantics. The current MCP
provider path must not assume `execution_id` is already available at the
terminal adapter decision site.

### Watchdog timeout mapping

`GenerationWatchdogTimeout` is already handled in the `watch()` method of
`GenerationProgressWatchdog` (`src/ouroboros/evolution/watchdog.py:65–91`) and
returned to the evolution loop as a failed generation outcome. The watchdog
source-specific emission must preserve the current generation control contract:
the directive for a watchdog timeout is the same directive the existing
evolution loop would have emitted for that failed generation outcome via
`step_action_to_directive(StepAction.FAILED, retry_budget_remaining=...)`.
That means the generation retry/resilience budget decides `Directive.RETRY`
versus `Directive.CANCEL`; `timeout_kind` is metadata/classification in
`extra`, not the authority for the directive value.

Issue #836 should therefore avoid a `watchdog_timeout_to_directive` helper that
maps `timeout_kind` directly to `Directive.RETRY` or `Directive.CANCEL`. If
#836 introduces watchdog-specific helper wiring, it must either call
`step_action_to_directive(...)` with the same retry budget the evolution loop
would use, or accept the already-computed directive from the loop. The watchdog
event appends `control.directive.emitted` with
`emitted_by="generation.watchdog"`, `target_type="lineage"`,
`target_id=lineage_id`, and `extra` including `timeout_kind`, thresholds, and
the watchdog decision metadata needed for audit.

The watchdog source owns source-specific directive identity for
`GenerationWatchdogTimeout` instances raised by `GenerationProgressWatchdog`,
but it must not suppress or bypass the generation retry-budget semantics. A
caller that catches the bubbled exception, including the current `evolve_step`
path that can emit a generic `emitted_by="evolver"` directive for a failed
generation, must not emit a second directive for the same watchdog timeout. The
deduplication key is the timeout decision identity: `target_type`, `target_id`,
timeout source (`GenerationWatchdogTimeout` / `generation.watchdog`),
`timeout_kind`, and the triggering watchdog decision event or timestamp
recorded with the existing lineage watchdog decision. If a source-specific
`generation.watchdog` directive exists for that key, the generic evolver
directive for the same failed generation is suppressed or replaced while
preserving the directive value that `step_action_to_directive(...)` and the
resilience budget selected. A generic evolver directive is allowed only when no
source-specific timeout directive already exists for the same timeout decision.

### Auto pipeline timeout mapping

Phase timeouts in `src/ouroboros/auto/pipeline.py` catch `asyncio.TimeoutError`
and update mutable `AutoPipelineState`. Every auto-pipeline `except
TimeoutError` branch that marks the state blocked, enforces the pipeline
deadline, or returns early must emit exactly one source-specific
`control.directive.emitted` event at the timeout decision point. Terminal
`Directive.CANCEL` branches may emit at the terminal decision before the state
mutation or immediately before the early return. Non-terminal
`Directive.RETRY` branches must first persist and commit, or atomically commit
with the directive emission, the retry-pending state transition that makes the
retry durable. A non-terminal `RETRY` event must never become durable without
the corresponding durable retry marker. The event target is always
`target_type="session"`, `target_id=state.auto_session_id`; `extra` should
include the current `state.phase.value`, the timeout seconds used by the
bounded call when available, `state.last_tool_name` or the tool name being
marked, and any phase-specific handle fields needed for resume
(`run_handoff_status`, `ralph_job_id`, `ralph_lineage_id`,
`ralph_dispatch_mode`).

Most auto-pipeline timeout branches are terminal for the current auto attempt:
interview, seed generation, repair, review, Ralph handoff, Ralph poll,
evaluator, and lateral-thinker timeouts emit `Directive.CANCEL` when they block
or return early. The run-handoff branch is the only currently defined
auto-pipeline timeout branch with a non-terminal retry directive: first
`"unknown_timeout"` while no retry has been attempted emits `Directive.RETRY`;
retried `"unknown_timeout"`, `"unknown_retry_failed"`, or a deadline
enforcement path emits `Directive.CANCEL`. For the first `auto.run_handoff`
`RETRY`, the persisted `run_start_attempted`/`run_handoff_status` transition is
the retry-pending marker and must be durable before, or atomically with,
`control.directive.emitted`.

## Invariants

**I1 — One directive per timeout decision.** Every timeout that advances or
terminates a run produces exactly one `control.directive.emitted` event. Retries
that are invisible to the caller (e.g. internal MCP adapter retries within a
single call-site invocation) do not each emit a directive; only the
caller-visible decision point does.

**I2 — `emitted_by` distinguishes source surfaces.** The `emitted_by` string
uses a two-segment dot notation (`<surface>.<sub-surface>` as shown in the
mapping table) so projectors and audit tools can filter by origin without
inspecting `extra`.

**I3 — Terminal vs non-terminal is explicit.** Each emitted directive's
`is_terminal` property (defined on `Directive` in `src/ouroboros/core/directive.py:99`)
must match the actual run outcome at that site. `Directive.CANCEL` is terminal;
`Directive.RETRY` is not. No site may emit a terminal directive and then
continue executing.

**I4 — Resume combines the trailing directive with local state.** On session
resume, the control-plane consumer reads the last `control.directive.emitted`
event for the relevant target before deciding whether to continue or abort.
This links to #578 item 4 (resume-path directive consumption). A terminal
`CANCEL` directive on resume is authoritative and must not restart work. A
non-terminal `RETRY` directive is actionable only while the corresponding
persisted local retry-pending state or token still indicates that the retry is
pending; if the owning surface has since succeeded or transitioned state, that
local state supersedes the stale trailing `RETRY` without requiring a success
directive. The current MCP Phase 1 contract has no such persisted token, so MCP
does not emit `Directive.RETRY`. Producers must preserve the same ordering on
write: a non-terminal `RETRY` may be appended only after, or in the same atomic
commit as, the persisted retry-pending state transition that makes it
actionable on resume.

**I5 — Retry success clears actionability without success spam.** If a
timed-out operation succeeds on a subsequent attempt, no additional
`control.directive.emitted` event is emitted for the success. The owning
surface instead clears or updates its persisted retry-pending state or token as
part of the normal success/state transition. The earlier `RETRY` remains in the
directive journal as the recorded timeout decision, but it is no longer
actionable on resume once local state shows that the retry has completed or the
operation has moved to a later state. Surfaces without persisted
retry-pending state, including current MCP Phase 1, must keep internal retry
attempts out of the directive journal. This keeps the directive journal as a
decision log, not a full-trace log.

**I6 — Non-terminal retry durability is atomic with its marker.** A
non-terminal `RETRY` directive and its owning surface's retry-pending marker
are a single durable resume contract. If the marker cannot be persisted, the
directive must not be appended. If the directive append succeeds, resume must be
able to find the corresponding marker and determine whether the retry remains
pending.

## Migration plan

Migration is phased to keep blast radius small. Each step is additive and
independently deployable. No flag day required.

### Phase 1 — MCP tool timeout target plumbing and terminal emission

`MCPTimeoutError` is produced by the manager and consumed within the
orchestrator layer. No lineage state is touched on this path. Phase 1 emits
only terminal MCP timeout directives because `_call_with_retry(...)` and
`Result.err(MCPTimeoutError)` do not persist retry-pending state. Emit one
terminal `Directive.CANCEL` from the caller-visible terminal decision site when
the `MAX_RETRIES`/adapter envelope is exhausted and a terminal tool error is
returned. Phase 1 also requires an API/plumbing change for the emission target:
either pass an execution/session/control target context through
`MCPToolProvider.call_tool(...)` and `_call_with_retry(...)`, or select a
different aggregation target that is already available at the terminal decision
site and document its resume semantics. The current `MCPToolProvider` call path
must not be treated as if `execution_id` or session context is already
available at `_call_with_retry(...)`.

### Phase 2 — Auto handoff timeout

Implement the run-handoff branch first because it already has a bounded retry
state machine (`run_handoff_status`, `run_start_attempted`, and
`run_handoff_guidance`) and is the narrowest auto-pipeline change. Add the
`control.directive.emitted` emission at the existing timeout decision point.
For the non-terminal first-time `RETRY`, commit the
`run_start_attempted`/`run_handoff_status` retry-pending transition before, or
atomically with, the directive append. Terminal `CANCEL` paths may emit at the
terminal decision or immediately before the early return. `state.auto_session_id`
is available throughout the pipeline.

### Phase 2b — Remaining auto-pipeline timeout branches

Extend the same auto-pipeline helper to every other `except TimeoutError`
branch that marks blocked or returns early: interview, seed generation, repair,
review, Ralph handoff, Ralph poll, evaluator, and lateral thinker. This phase
is still additive and small-blast-radius because it changes only emission at
existing timeout decision points; it does not alter phase ordering, retry
counts, state transitions, or resume behavior.

### Phase 3 — Watchdog timeout (deferred to #836)

`GenerationProgressWatchdog.watch()` already calls `emit_decision()`. Phase 3
adds the source-specific `control.directive.emitted` call alongside the
existing lineage event without changing the generation retry-budget contract.
#836 must not map `timeout_kind` directly to `Directive.RETRY` or
`Directive.CANCEL`; it should preserve the directive that the failed generation
would receive through `step_action_to_directive(...)` with the active
resilience budget, and record `timeout_kind` only in `extra`.

## Non-goals

- **Not replacing per-surface timeout configuration.** `RuntimeControlsConfig`
  fields (`mcp_tool_timeout_seconds`, `generation_idle_timeout_seconds`, etc.)
  remain as-is. This RFC does not propose a unified timeout config object.

- **Not replacing existing exception types.** `MCPTimeoutError`,
  `GenerationWatchdogTimeout`, and `asyncio.TimeoutError` remain. This RFC
  layers an emission requirement on top; it does not create a new exception
  hierarchy.

- **Not changing cancellation mechanisms.** The MCP adapter's internal retry
  loop, the watchdog's `task.cancel()`, and the auto pipeline's early-return
  pattern are all preserved. The directive emission is observational; it does
  not change how cancellation propagates.

- **Not adding new ControlBus wiring or a reactive consumer.** Reactive
  consumption of `control.directive.emitted` is explicitly deferred per the
  "observational-first" stance documented in `src/ouroboros/events/control.py:43`.
  `control_bus.py` already exists; this RFC adds emission sites only and does
  not expand ControlBus wiring.

## Open questions

None. This RFC intentionally makes the auto-pipeline timeout coverage and MCP
retry-budget authority decisive. Future implementation PRs may choose helper
names and wiring details, but not different directive semantics.
