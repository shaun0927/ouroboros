## Summary

Three independent timeout surfaces exist today. Each raises or returns its own
timeout representation and signals cancellation through its own mechanism.
They do not provide a consistent, source-specific `control.directive.emitted`
signal, so the control plane has no unified visibility into why a run was
interrupted. This RFC proposes a contract that maps every timeout surface onto
the `Directive` vocabulary and requires each site to emit
`control.directive.emitted` as the canonical control-plane signal.

## Context

### Surface 1 — MCP tool timeout

**Files:** `src/ouroboros/mcp/errors.py`, `src/ouroboros/mcp/client/manager.py`,
`src/ouroboros/orchestrator/mcp_tools.py`, `src/ouroboros/config/models.py`

`MCPTimeoutError` (defined in `src/ouroboros/mcp/errors.py:170`) is a subclass
of `MCPClientError` and is returned as `Result.err(...)` by the MCP client
manager (`src/ouroboros/mcp/client/manager.py:460–463`) when an MCP tool call
exceeds its wall-clock budget. The timeout budget is controlled by
`RuntimeControlsConfig.mcp_tool_timeout_seconds` (default `0`, which disables
the adapter-level guard):

```python
# src/ouroboros/config/models.py:322
mcp_tool_timeout_seconds: float = Field(default=0, ge=0)
```

`MCPTimeoutError` is marked `is_retriable=True` at construction. The retry
logic in `src/ouroboros/orchestrator/mcp_tools.py:2156` catches raised
`(MCPConnectionError, asyncio.TimeoutError)` exceptions and re-attempts up to
`MAX_RETRIES` times before emitting the structured log event
`orchestrator.mcp_tools.timeout_after_retries` and returning a non-retriable
tool error. Manager-originated `MCPTimeoutError` values currently bypass that
exception retry path because they are returned as `Result.err(...)`; the
orchestrator converts them through its generic `call_failed` path. No
`control.directive.emitted` event is produced.

### Surface 2 — Generation watchdog timeout

**Files:** `src/ouroboros/evolution/watchdog.py`, `src/ouroboros/config/models.py`

`GenerationWatchdogTimeout` (defined in `src/ouroboros/evolution/watchdog.py:65`)
is raised by `GenerationProgressWatchdog._raise_if_threshold_exceeded` when one
of three thresholds is breached:

- `generation_idle_timeout_seconds` (default 7200 s) — no event activity
- `generation_no_progress_timeout_seconds` (default 14400 s) — activity without
  material progress
- `generation_safety_timeout_seconds` (default `0`, disabled) — absolute
  wall-clock cap

When raised, the watchdog calls `emit_decision(action="timeout", ...)` which
persists a `lineage.generation.watchdog_decision` event via the `EventStore`.
This is a lineage-scoped event, not a `control.directive.emitted` event, so it
does not appear in the control-plane directive stream. One caller path,
`evolve_step`, can later convert the failed step into a generic
`control.directive.emitted` event with `emitted_by="evolver"`; that does not
identify the watchdog timeout as the source surface.

### Surface 3 — Auto-run handoff timeout

**Files:** `src/ouroboros/auto/pipeline.py`, `src/ouroboros/config/models.py`

The auto pipeline coordinates interview, seed generation, repair, review, run
handoff, Ralph handoff/poll, evaluator, and lateral-thinker phases. Each
long-running phase runs under a `TimeoutError`-bounded `asyncio` call. The
run-start phase is the most nuanced: a first `TimeoutError` sets
`run_handoff_status = "unknown_timeout"` and schedules one retry; a second
`TimeoutError` on the retry leaves the status as `"unknown_timeout"` and blocks
further attempts. The `"unknown_retry_failed"` status is used by the non-timeout
exception path on the retry:

```python
# src/ouroboros/auto/pipeline.py:801–814
except TimeoutError as exc:
    if self._enforce_deadline(state):
        return self._result(state, ledger, review=review, blocker=state.last_error)
    _mark_unknown_run_handoff(state, status="unknown_timeout")
    if retried:
        state.run_handoff_guidance = (...)
        state.mark_blocked(...)
        ...
        return self._result(...)
```

No `control.directive.emitted` event is produced for any phase timeout. The
caller learns about the timeout only through the in-memory/persisted `state`
object's `last_error`, phase, resume tool, and run/Ralph handoff fields.

## Problem

The three surfaces described above share no control-plane representation:

1. **Three exception types** — `MCPTimeoutError`, `GenerationWatchdogTimeout`,
   and `asyncio.TimeoutError` (re-raised by the auto pipeline) — carry
   incompatible fields and are caught at different abstraction levels.

2. **Three cancellation mechanisms** — the MCP layer retries internally then
   raises; the watchdog cancels the async task then persists a lineage event;
   the auto pipeline writes to a mutable `state` object and returns early.

3. **No shared source-specific signal** — these timeout surfaces do not emit a
   consistent `control.directive.emitted` event at the timeout decision point. A
   lineage projector, TUI renderer, or external monitor cannot reconstruct
   *why* a run stopped from the directive journal alone.

This gap is item 5 of Q00/ouroboros#578, which asks for a unified
control-plane representation across all timeout surfaces so that consumers can
treat `control.directive.emitted` as the sole authoritative signal for "a
runtime decision was made here."

## Proposed contract

All three surfaces must emit `control.directive.emitted` via
`create_control_directive_emitted_event` from `src/ouroboros/events/control.py`
at the local timeout decision point. The event is the sole authoritative
control-plane signal that a timeout caused a retry, block, cancellation, or
early return. Existing exception types, state mutation, and lineage events
remain as local implementation details; consumers should derive timeout control
decisions from the directive journal, with non-terminal retry actionability
resolved against the owning surface's persisted retry-pending state as defined
in I4.

The `emitted_by` field distinguishes the source surface. The `directive` field
is determined per-surface as follows.

### Mapping table

| Surface | `emitted_by` | `directive` | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| MCP tool timeout | `"mcp.tool_timeout"` | `Directive.RETRY` | adapter exposes caller-visible retry with `MAX_RETRIES` budget remaining |
| MCP tool timeout | `"mcp.tool_timeout"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `MAX_RETRIES` budget exhausted and terminal tool error returned |
| Watchdog timeout | `"generation.watchdog"` | mapped by `watchdog_timeout_to_directive` (proposed in #836) | budget-dependent |
| Auto interview timeout | `"auto.interview"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `interview_driver.run(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto seed-generation timeout | `"auto.seed_generation"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `seed_generator(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto repair timeout | `"auto.repair"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `repairer.converge(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto review timeout | `"auto.review"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `reviewer.review(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto handoff timeout — first occurrence | `"auto.run_handoff"` | `Directive.RETRY` | `run_handoff_status == "unknown_timeout"` and not yet retried |
| Auto handoff timeout — terminal | `"auto.run_handoff"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | retry exhausted while still `unknown_timeout`, retry failed with `unknown_retry_failed`, or deadline enforced |
| Auto Ralph handoff timeout | `"auto.ralph_handoff"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `ralph_starter(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto Ralph poll timeout | `"auto.ralph_poll"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `ralph_resumer(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto evaluator timeout | `"auto.evaluate"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `evaluator(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |
| Auto lateral-thinker timeout | `"auto.lateral"` | `Directive.CANCEL` | `lateral_thinker(...)` times out and the pipeline marks blocked or returns early |

### MCP tool timeout mapping

`MCPTimeoutError` sets `is_retriable=True`. The authoritative retry budget for
MCP timeout directives is the adapter retry envelope in
`src/ouroboros/orchestrator/mcp_tools.py`: `MAX_RETRIES` and the surrounding
`retry_async(..., attempts=MAX_RETRIES)` policy. This budget applies to both
raised timeout paths (`asyncio.TimeoutError` caught by `retry_async`) and
manager-originated `Result.err(MCPTimeoutError)` values. The manager path must
be lifted into the same envelope or explicitly consume the same counter at the
`Result.err` decision point; it must not define a second retry budget.

`Directive.RETRY` is emitted only when the adapter exposes a caller-visible
retry decision before the terminal result, with retry budget remaining under
that envelope. Internal retry attempts hidden inside a single tool invocation
do not each emit. `Directive.CANCEL` is emitted when the same budget is
exhausted and the adapter returns the terminal non-retriable tool error, such
as the existing `orchestrator.mcp_tools.timeout_after_retries` path. The event
target is `target_type="execution"` with `execution_id` from the surrounding
context.

### Watchdog timeout mapping

`GenerationWatchdogTimeout` is already handled in the `watch()` method of
`GenerationProgressWatchdog` (`src/ouroboros/evolution/watchdog.py:65–91`).
Issue #836 proposes a `watchdog_timeout_to_directive` helper that maps
`timeout_kind` to `Directive.RETRY` (transient; material progress recoverable)
or `Directive.CANCEL` (safety or idle threshold exceeded). The watchdog site
calls this helper immediately after its existing `emit_decision()` call and
appends the corresponding `control.directive.emitted` event with
`emitted_by="generation.watchdog"`. Target: `target_type="lineage"`,
`target_id=lineage_id`.

The watchdog owns directive emission for `GenerationWatchdogTimeout` instances
raised by `GenerationProgressWatchdog`. A caller that catches the bubbled
exception, including the current `evolve_step` path that can emit a generic
`emitted_by="evolver"` directive, must not emit a second directive for the same
watchdog timeout. The deduplication key is the timeout decision identity:
`target_type`, `target_id`, timeout source (`GenerationWatchdogTimeout` /
`generation.watchdog`), `timeout_kind`, and the triggering watchdog decision
event or timestamp recorded with the existing lineage watchdog decision. If a
source-specific `generation.watchdog` directive exists for that key, the
generic evolver timeout directive is suppressed or replaced. A generic evolver
timeout directive is allowed only when no source-specific timeout directive
already exists for the same timeout decision.

### Auto pipeline timeout mapping

Phase timeouts in `src/ouroboros/auto/pipeline.py` catch `asyncio.TimeoutError`
and update mutable `AutoPipelineState`. Every auto-pipeline `except
TimeoutError` branch that marks the state blocked, enforces the pipeline
deadline, or returns early must emit exactly one source-specific
`control.directive.emitted` event before the state mutation or immediately
before the early return. The event target is always `target_type="session"`,
`target_id=state.auto_session_id`; `extra` should include the current
`state.phase.value`, the timeout seconds used by the bounded call when
available, `state.last_tool_name` or the tool name being marked, and any
phase-specific handle fields needed for resume (`run_handoff_status`,
`ralph_job_id`, `ralph_lineage_id`, `ralph_dispatch_mode`).

Most auto-pipeline timeout branches are terminal for the current auto attempt:
interview, seed generation, repair, review, Ralph handoff, Ralph poll,
evaluator, and lateral-thinker timeouts emit `Directive.CANCEL` when they block
or return early. The run-handoff branch is the only currently defined
auto-pipeline timeout branch with a non-terminal retry directive: first
`"unknown_timeout"` while no retry has been attempted emits `Directive.RETRY`;
retried `"unknown_timeout"`, `"unknown_retry_failed"`, or a deadline
enforcement path emits `Directive.CANCEL`.

## Invariants

**I1 — One directive per timeout decision.** Every timeout that advances or
terminates a run produces exactly one `control.directive.emitted` event. Retries
that are invisible to the caller (e.g. internal MCP adapter retries within a
single call-site invocation) do not each emit a directive; only the
caller-visible decision point does.

**I2 — `emitted_by` distinguishes source surfaces.** The `emitted_by` string
uses a two-segment dot notation (`<surface>.<sub-surface>` as shown in the
mapping table) so projectors and audit tools can filter by origin without
inspecting `extra`.

**I3 — Terminal vs non-terminal is explicit.** Each emitted directive's
`is_terminal` property (defined on `Directive` in `src/ouroboros/core/directive.py:99`)
must match the actual run outcome at that site. `Directive.CANCEL` is terminal;
`Directive.RETRY` is not. No site may emit a terminal directive and then
continue executing.

**I4 — Resume combines the trailing directive with local state.** On session
resume, the control-plane consumer reads the last `control.directive.emitted`
event for the relevant target before deciding whether to continue or abort.
This links to #578 item 4 (resume-path directive consumption). A terminal
`CANCEL` directive on resume is authoritative and must not restart work. A
non-terminal `RETRY` directive is actionable only while the corresponding
persisted local retry-pending state or token still indicates that the retry is
pending; if the owning surface has since succeeded or transitioned state, that
local state supersedes the stale trailing `RETRY` without requiring a success
directive.

**I5 — Retry success clears actionability without success spam.** If a
timed-out operation succeeds on a subsequent attempt, no additional
`control.directive.emitted` event is emitted for the success. The owning
surface instead clears or updates its persisted retry-pending state or token as
part of the normal success/state transition. The earlier `RETRY` remains in the
directive journal as the recorded timeout decision, but it is no longer
actionable on resume once local state shows that the retry has completed or the
operation has moved to a later state. This keeps the directive journal as a
decision log, not a full-trace log.

## Migration plan

Migration is phased to keep blast radius small. Each step is additive and
independently deployable. No flag day required.

### Phase 1 — MCP tool timeout (smallest blast radius)

`MCPTimeoutError` is produced by the manager and consumed within the
orchestrator layer. No lineage state is touched on this path. First decide
whether manager timeouts should be raised into `retry_async` or handled from the
returned `Result.err(MCPTimeoutError)` value; emit `control.directive.emitted`
from that caller-visible decision site. Requires passing `execution_id` into
the emission context; this context is already available via the surrounding
tool-invocation frame.

### Phase 2 — Auto handoff timeout

Implement the run-handoff branch first because it already has a bounded retry
state machine (`run_handoff_status`, `run_start_attempted`, and
`run_handoff_guidance`) and is the narrowest auto-pipeline change. Add the
`control.directive.emitted` emission immediately before the existing state
mutation or early return. `state.auto_session_id` is available throughout the
pipeline.

### Phase 2b — Remaining auto-pipeline timeout branches

Extend the same auto-pipeline helper to every other `except TimeoutError`
branch that marks blocked or returns early: interview, seed generation, repair,
review, Ralph handoff, Ralph poll, evaluator, and lateral thinker. This phase
is still additive and small-blast-radius because it changes only emission at
existing timeout decision points; it does not alter phase ordering, retry
counts, state transitions, or resume behavior.

### Phase 3 — Watchdog timeout (deferred to #836)

`GenerationProgressWatchdog.watch()` already calls `emit_decision()`. Phase 3
adds the `watchdog_timeout_to_directive` function (proposed in #836) and
appends the corresponding `control.directive.emitted` call alongside the
existing lineage event. This phase is deferred because #836 must first settle
the `timeout_kind → Directive` mapping.

## Non-goals

- **Not replacing per-surface timeout configuration.** `RuntimeControlsConfig`
  fields (`mcp_tool_timeout_seconds`, `generation_idle_timeout_seconds`, etc.)
  remain as-is. This RFC does not propose a unified timeout config object.

- **Not replacing existing exception types.** `MCPTimeoutError`,
  `GenerationWatchdogTimeout`, and `asyncio.TimeoutError` remain. This RFC
  layers an emission requirement on top; it does not create a new exception
  hierarchy.

- **Not changing cancellation mechanisms.** The MCP adapter's internal retry
  loop, the watchdog's `task.cancel()`, and the auto pipeline's early-return
  pattern are all preserved. The directive emission is observational; it does
  not change how cancellation propagates.

- **Not introducing a ControlBus or reactive consumer.** Reactive consumption
  of `control.directive.emitted` is explicitly deferred per the
  "observational-first" stance documented in `src/ouroboros/events/control.py:43`.
  This RFC adds emission sites only.

## Open questions

None. This RFC intentionally makes the auto-pipeline timeout coverage and MCP
retry-budget authority decisive. Future implementation PRs may choose helper
names and wiring details, but not different directive semantics.
