"""`ooo plugin` command group.

UserLevel plugin manager CLI. Implements Q00/ouroboros#731 (locked spec).

This file contains the **read-only** subcommands (`discover`, `inspect`,
`list`). State-mutating subcommands (`add`, `install`, `trust`, `disable`,
`remove`) are added in a follow-up PR; the module structure is laid out
here so the follow-up plugs in cleanly.
