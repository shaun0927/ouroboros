"""Typed evidence record + validator (RFC v2 H2, #830).

Turns the H2 invariant from "the markdown says emit evidence" into a parser-
enforced contract: leaf executors emit a structured evidence record, the
harness validates it against the active ExecutionProfile's evidence_schema
before accepting the result.

This module is pure validator surface — it does not yet wire into
parallel_executor. The H1 verifier loop (next PR in the stack) consumes
the ValidationResult to decide between accept / retry / escalate.

The evaluator for `rejected_if` is intentionally narrow. It supports only
`<field> == <literal>` where literal is parsed first as JSON (so YAML/JSON
authors can write `null`, `true`, `false`, numbers, strings, lists) and
then as a Python literal as a fallback (so legacy `None`/`True`/`False`
keep working). Any other expression shape raises EvidenceError so that
profile authors get an immediate, loud failure instead of silent acceptance.

Usage:
    from ouroboros.orchestrator.evidence_schema import (
        extract_evidence, validate_evidence,
    )
    record = extract_evidence(raw_leaf_text)
    result = validate_evidence(profile, record)
    if not result.ok:
        # surface result.missing_fields / result.rejected_by to the harness
        ...
