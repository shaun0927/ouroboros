"""Adaptive model/tool routing (RFC v2 H5, #830).

H5 moves model and tool selection out of skills and into the harness.
The skill never picks a model. Each dispatch has a role (decomposer /
executor / verifier), and the harness chooses an appropriate tier and
tool set per role + profile.

Tiers are intentionally abstract strings rather than concrete model
IDs — the integration PR (PR 9) maps `ModelTier.HAIKU / SONNET / OPUS`
onto the adapter's current model knobs. Decoupling lets profile
authors think in cost/quality bands rather than vendor SKU drift.

Implementation status at this PR:

  DECOMPOSER (implemented)
    Tier HAIKU. Tools = (). Decomposition is structured-output
    planning; HAIKU keeps the per-AC fixed cost low and tools are
    intentionally empty.

  EXECUTOR (implemented)
    Tier SONNET by default. Escalates to OPUS when
    `fabrication_retry=True` per the H7 ESCALATE_MODEL hook.
    Tools come from `profile.suggested_tools` verbatim.

  VERIFIER (implemented)
    Routing verifier dispatches is based on the structured
    `ExecutionProfile.verifier_capability` field. Read-only discovery
    verifiers receive file-discovery tools only; subprocess-test-runner
    verifiers additionally receive Bash so they can run bounded tests.

This module is wiring-only. `parallel_executor` still uses its current
hardcoded adapter call. `decide_route()` takes role + profile + retry
hint — no AC text — until a profile demands per-AC routing.
