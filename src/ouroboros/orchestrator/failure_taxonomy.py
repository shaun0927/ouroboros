"""Failure classifier + recovery policy (RFC v2 H7, #830).

H7 replaces the count-based retry in `parallel_executor` with a
classifier: every failed leaf attempt is mapped to a FailureClass, and
each class maps to a RecoveryPolicy that the orchestrator can act on.

Currently `retry_attempt` in parallel_executor is a stall counter — it
re-dispatches the same prompt with no notion of *why* the previous
attempt failed. After PR 9 wires this module in, the harness will
inspect the verifier's Attempt transcript, classify it, and route to
the right recovery (retry / escalate model / redispatch / human).

This module ships the classifier + policy table only. parallel_executor
stays count-based until the integration PR.
