"""Decorate auto-pipeline blocker messages with phase + backend attribution.

Issue #690 surfaced a class of incidents where a goal like
"open and merge a PR" hit ``interview.start timed out after 60s`` and
the user could not tell whether the timeout came from the in-process
authoring path or from the runtime adapter behind ``--runtime <X>``.

This helper appends a single
``[phase=<step>, authoring_backend=<resolved>]`` suffix to a blocker
message. It does not change timeout values, retry counts, or resume
semantics — those belong to the dedicated tickets (#686, #688).
