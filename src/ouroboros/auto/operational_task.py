"""Classify ``ooo auto`` goals as operational vs ideation.

Operational goals — concrete asks like "review PR <url>", "merge PR <url>",
"fix the failing tests in <repo>" — already carry enough execution context
that the Socratic interview is at best a tax and at worst the wrong tool
(a single first-question timeout strands the entire session, see #692).

This module is **pure**: a deterministic function over a goal string
returning a structured classification. The pipeline-side rewiring lives in
the follow-up PR (#689 part 2) so the classifier can be reviewed and
exercised under test in isolation.

The classification carries the *intent* the pipeline needs to choose a
direct path or an interview-first path, plus a side-effect risk label so
later code can require an explicit confirmation gate before any destructive
action (merge, close).
