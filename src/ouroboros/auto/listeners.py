"""Event listeners that mirror linked subsystem state into ``AutoPipelineState``.

This module exists so the unified status surface (Q00/ouroboros#782) can answer
"where is my session?" without polling. The listener subscribes to the
``mcp.job.*`` topics emitted by ``JobManager`` (``mcp.job.status`` /
``mcp.job.cancelled`` / ``mcp.job.terminal``) via the existing ``EventStore``
incremental query API and updates four mirror fields on ``AutoPipelineState``:

- ``ralph_job_status`` — last-seen ``JobStatus`` value
- ``ralph_last_event_at`` — ISO timestamp of the last event
- ``ralph_stop_reason`` — populated when the ralph job reaches a terminal status
- ``ralph_current_generation`` — last reported lineage generation index

Cancel propagation: when ``JobManager.cancel_job`` drives the linked ralph job
into ``cancelled`` (or the persisted equivalent), the listener marks the auto
state ``BLOCKED("ralph cancelled by user")`` — but only if the auto session is
not already in a terminal phase, otherwise we would clobber a successful
``COMPLETE`` with a noisy blocker.

Status readers call :func:`replay_ralph_job_events` before rendering so the
persisted auto snapshot reflects already-written ``mcp.job.*`` events even
when no background subscriber is running.
