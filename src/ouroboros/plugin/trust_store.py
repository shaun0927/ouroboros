"""Per-plugin trust store.

Persists granted trust scopes per plugin at
`~/.ouroboros/plugins/<name>/trust.json`. Per the locked Q00/ouroboros#732
spec (which consumes the locked Q00/ouroboros-plugins#9 trust UX answers):

- **Per-user storage** (Q5): one trust file per installed plugin, in the
  same per-user directory as the plugin home.
- **Version-bump invalidation** (Q4): when a plugin's version changes,
  the trust file is reset (granted_scopes emptied). The user must re-grant
  scopes via `ooo plugin trust` after upgrading.
- **Exact scope grants** (Q3): each grant records the exact scope string;
  parent scopes do not imply children.
- **No raw tokens stored.** Only the scope name, timestamp, and granting
  user identity are persisted.

The trust store does NOT emit audit events itself; the firewall (#729) and
CLI (#731) emit `plugin.trusted` when grants happen, sourcing the data
from this store.
