"""Plugin lifecycle hook contract types.

This module defines the typed vocabulary used to validate and dispatch
v1 plugin lifecycle hooks. The shape mirrors the contract documented in
``docs/rfc/userlevel-plugins.md``.

What this module owns:

* :class:`HookKind` — the v1 hook vocabulary. Only the hooks listed as
  "Included" in the RFC are enumerated; deferred hooks are exposed
  separately via :class:`DeferredHookKind` so we can keep an
  explicit, audit-friendly record of v1 vs future scope without
  silently accepting them at manifest-validation time.
* :class:`HookFailurePolicy` — the v1 failure policies (``fail_open``
  / ``fail_closed``).
* :data:`HOOK_EVENT_TYPES` — the v1 hook event names vendored in the
  manifest/audit schemas and emitted or reserved by the firewall
  lifecycle wrapper (``plugin.hook.invoked``,
  ``plugin.hook.completed``, ``plugin.hook.blocked``, and
  ``plugin.hook.failed``).
* :func:`is_v1_hook_kind` / :func:`is_v1_failure_policy` — helpers
  consumed by manifest validators. They live here so the contract is
  the single source of truth.

This module deliberately stays contract-only: runtime execution belongs
to ``ouroboros.plugin.firewall`` and manifest shape belongs to the
versioned schemas plus ``ouroboros.plugin.manifest``.
